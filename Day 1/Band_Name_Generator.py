#I'm not using Repl like suggested on the course, I started in Hard Mode with Visual Studio Code on my machine and the many issues getting git to work and also python, you can install it from the web fair enough but try running it in VS Code and suddenly its all like 'whoa dude I don't have Python installed, go get it from the Microsoft store' and im like WTF dude its installed... fine ill uninstall it and grab 3.9 from the windows store, bitch... oh now it suddenly works seemlessly... ah well can't complain too much its working and that the most important part. Anyhoos if you made it this far congratulations and ill see you tomorrow for Day 2 of the 100 days of code.

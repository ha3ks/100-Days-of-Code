#Day 27
#Felt the real struggle bus yesterday, lets see how I get on with a fresh set of eyes. I know the course pledge says 100 days of code but it does not say consecutive so I feel I can get awat with having one day off as long as I justify and note it... becuase Github streak! like a kill streak in COD but instead of 'AGM online' its nerd cred!
